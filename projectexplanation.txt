This project aims to develop a json parser in c++
It will be developed as highlighted below

1. The input will be a JSON file eg json.json 
2. The file will be read line by line and then trimmed for whitespace and similar non-characters.
3. The file will extract the key and its value and store the latter in a json base class,
 and the former in a field in an unordered hash map, together with the latter.
